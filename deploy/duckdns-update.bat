REM DuckDNS auto-update for the Classroom Library (Windows).
REM Keeps your DuckDNS hostname(s) pointed at your current public IP.
REM
REM SETUP
REM   1. Edit the two lines below with your DuckDNS domain(s) + token.
REM   2. Test once:   duckdns-update.bat
REM   3. Create a scheduled task to run it every 5 minutes:
REM        schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 5 /tn "DuckDNS Update" /tr "C:\classroomlib\deploy\duckdns-update.bat"
REM
REM TWO APPS, ONE MACHINE: list both hostnames comma-separated, and run the
REM updater from ONE repo only — one scheduled task updates both:
REM   set DUCKDNS_DOMAINS=mybookrecs,myroomlibrary

set DUCKDNS_DOMAINS=myroomlibrary
set DUCKDNS_TOKEN=your-token-here

curl -k "https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=%DUCKDNS_DOMAINS%&token=%DUCKDNS_TOKEN%&ip="
echo.
